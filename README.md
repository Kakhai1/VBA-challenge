Repo for Data bootcamp VBA Challenge Wk 2
This repo contains examples of applications taught by a data science bootcamp demonstrating proficiency in VBA coding within a large dataset containing stock market data.
Therefore most of the code is inspired by lessons from these bootcamp classes and resources.

The application of VBA dictionaries were explained by ChatGPT, a language model which provides concise and understandable information (in this case regarding VBA scripting and how it is done). This information was then taken and modified for use within the VBA scrips contained within this file.
